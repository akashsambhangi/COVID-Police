"Social Distance detector + Face Mask Detection"
During the COVID Pandemic it has become extreamly important for us to keep ourselves safe from the virus.
There are two steps which must be followed by every responsible citizen while in public places and they are:-
1. Maintain safe social distance from other people.
2. Always wear a mask/cover nose and mouth to avoid inhaling the virus.

Imagine a scenario like Bank queue where there can be number of peolpe in the line and ensuring all of them are following the two steps above is important and also monitoring them manually is a tedious process hence I have put together a solution which utilizes the power of Deep Learning to constantly monitor both 1 and 2.
